('5','greece','rhodes','/images/rhodes.jpg','My husband and I visited Rhodes this June. We had a very good time and were very impressed by the capital and by the quantity and beauty of the beaches.We had booked a superb studio which was right in the heart of the medieval capital, in a wonderful house.
 So we had all the time to wonder in the narrow streets of the City of Rhodes and admire the complexity and wonders of the medieval architecture; we were told that this city is the biggest medieval city of Europe and I am sure it is one of the most well preserved too.
Apart from the capital, which were our favourite place, we visited some very picturesque mountain villages, admired the rich and varied landscape of the island and relaxed on the golden sand of many endless beaches.
I recommend to everyone to go and discover the richness and charms of Rhodes.'

('1','japan','kyoto','/images/kyoto2.jpg','We really enjoyed our tiny house on a quiet residential street at the last stop of the metro line. It wasn’t perfect (no Airbnb is perfect) but it had more space and higher ceilings that we expected.
 It came with some “smart” devices – the microwave that had some useful programs, the bathtub we could fill by pressing a button on the kitchen wall, the cooktop that would detect when you left an empty pan and turn off by itself.
  There were also sliding doors, tatami mats, futons to sleep on and one beautiful paper window. And it didn’t matter that for the first week every morning greeted us with a fresh sprinkle of snow (which I generally hate and didn’t
  want to see again any time soon) nor that we had to blast aircon all day long to not freeze in the poorly insulated house.I was there to live my best Japanese life. Grilling fish for breakfast, properly separating the rubbish (including rinsing cans, plastic bottles and trays),
  enjoying the silence and greeting all my neighbours when I saw them on the street. Our neighbourhood was quiet, filled with small houses and equally miniature veggie gardens between them. There were a couple of big supermarkets, a pretty temple,
  a small hill with great views of the area and three cats that everyone seemed to know, feed and pet. I was told on two occasions that the grey one was the mother and the black one was the baby. I never learned the story of the third one that was always hiding and avoiding people.'

('5','tahiti','moorea','/images/moorea.jpg','Tahiti, you are under a lot of pressure, you and your 118 islands spread across the area of Europe. In the imagination of so many travellers you are the epitome of a tropical island paradise, with a bonus mix of French and Polynesian cultures.
 The weather alone is near perfect - water temperature in the high 20s year-round, and winter air temperature of about 27 degrees. The more affordable tourist season is April-May, while the wet season is during the hot summer months of December to March. Humpback whales call these waters
  home from August to December, when they journey from Antarctica to have their young.The island of Moorea is a 30-minute ferry trip from the capital, Papeete, where international flights land. Six ferries a day make the crossing, not just for tourists but also for the many Moorea locals who
   work in Papeete. My Tuesday afternoon ferry is packed with school children making the return journey to the smaller island, some clutching baguettes. Most resorts offer transfers from the ferry terminal, plus there are taxis or the islands one car rental, Avis, across the road. Moorea is
   encircled by a reef, with 12 natural breaks caused by freshwater running off the mountains, allowing access for fishing boats as well as cruise ships. Waves crash constantly a few hundred metres from shore, but inside the lagoon it is still and ideal for snorkelling and paddleboarding.'

('4','new zealand','auckland','/images/auckland.jpg','Visitors with just 1 day in Auckland have an array of options for what to see and do. We recommend spending an Auckland one-day trip seeing the sights and experiencing the city on foot. Many Auckland tourist attractions are located in the heart of the city – and others
are just a ferry ride away. We have made planning what to do in Auckland For A Day simple with our easy-to-follow Auckland itinerary.We begin our day of Auckland sightseeing in the center of the city – taking in sights like the historic Civic Theater, iconic Sky Tower and revitalized harbor.
We continue our Auckland city tour as we navigate to the west, to see the oldest part of the city and landmark War Memorial Museum. We complete our walk by strolling back to the city center through spacious city parks and the university campus. To end the day, we hop on a ferry to one of the best
Auckland getaways: Devonport…just 12 minutes away by boat!Our free Auckland walking tour highlights the top Auckland attractions. Visitors can simply enjoy the city by walking the route…or choose to visit the Auckland sights along the way. Three top Auckland activities that are along the route are
soaring to the top of the Sky Tower (buy tickets in advance!), eating lunch in the Wynyard Quarter and visiting the Auckland War Museum, which can include a cultural performance (buy tickets in advance!). If you plan on spending time at these top Auckland places to visit, be sure to calculate it
into your itinerary and keep an eye on the time. '

('2','tahiti','moorea','/images/moorea1.jpg','International flights to the islands fly through Tahiti (Aeroport International Tahiti Fa’a’a, airport code PPT), so we decided to spend 3 days/3 nights on Tahiti, the move on to her sister island of Moorea. We took a quick ferry ride (about 35 minute) to get
to the less-developed island, where we spent 6.5 days/6 nights. We took another ferry back to Tahiti to catch a flight to Bora Bora for 3 days/3 nights. Our flight out of Tahiti was at 7am, so we spent one final night on the main island before returning to Tokyo. I loved our itinerary, and felt like
we spent the perfect amount of time on each island. I would highly recommend something similar if you’re heading to French Polynesia for the first time.And a quick note about addresses in French Polynesia: most of the islands have a major road that runs around the perimeter of the island.
There are “PK” markers, or “poste kilometre” to signify the number of kilometers are you are from the center of town (on Tahiti, it’s Pape’ete). Addresses usually have a PK number so that you know when to start looking for the restaurant/hotel/etc. as you drive along the main road.The island of Tahiti
may by synonymous with “paradise,” but it’s definitely lost some of its luster since it earned that reputation. It’s the main island in French Polynesia, and has a grittier, slightly more urban feel than the other islands. It wasn’t our favorite stop on the trip, and I wouldn’t recommend spending more
 than a few days there. It does have some interesting cultural spots and a market that’s worth visiting, but it’s not necessarily the island you want to go to if you’re looking for a relaxing beach vacation.'

('3','japan','tokyo','/images/tokyo1.jpg','I was staying in Ginza, which is a high-end shopping district to the south-east of Tokyo train station, but I don’t think it really matters where you stay as all areas are pretty accessible by Tokyo metro.
In a big city, it’s always a good idea to get yourself up high to get a view of the place. The Tokyo Tower (Eiffel tower look-a-like) or Tokyo City View, both close to the Akasaka / Roppongi area both offer views, but both cost money.
Instead, head to the Municipal Building to the west of Shinjuku station, where you can get up high and get a view of Tokyo for no cost. If you’re lucky, you might be able to see Mount Fuji, though I never did due to either overcast skies or hazy smog.
Also to the west of Shinjuku is the Shinjuku NS building with its amazing 30 story atrium and the Park Hyatt hotel, which is a good place to go for some expensive drinks with a great view. It’s the same hotel featured in Sofia Coppola’s Lost in Translation.
To the east of Shinjuku is some great discount shopping, as well as the red light district and the area called the Golden Gai. The Golden Gai is a number of really small alleys filled with bars that many Japanese hit after work. However,
a number of places are private clubs or don’t allow foreigners inside. Those that do allow foreigners usually charge a cover charge and pricey drinks. It’s interesting to see, but may not be a great place to drink every night.'

('5','norway','trondheim','/images/trondheim.jpg','For us, Trondheim was a great opportunity to visit friends living there and to step foot in Norway for the first time. And yet another Scandinavian country that did not disappoint! Having someone local show us around was extremely helpful
 as we managed to get a good glimpse of the life in the city and what to see and do there.Let’s now take a look at some of the highlights of a long weekend in Trondheim.It’s impossible to walk around central Trondheim and not see Nidaros Cathedral towering over the other buildings.
 This cathedral from the 11th century is a gem of gothic architecture, certainly one of the most important monuments in Norway and the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world. Impressive, right? We have seen a lot of cathedrals but this is one really worth visiting,
including the interior which is very dark and different from a regular cathedral. And that’s not all, Nidaros is also the former location of coronation in Norway, now royal blessings, and an important pilgrimage destination. Just next door is the visitors center building
where you can buy tickets to visit the cathedral and the nearby Archbishop’s Palace and the Crown Regalia, which are definitely a good addition to any visit. Because we visited in May, we could not go to the top of the cathedral since it only opens during the summer.
The Market Square (Torvet) is the heart of Trondheim and when we visited, on a Saturday morning, this was clearly the busiest area with plenty of stalls selling different local produce. At the center of the square lies the monument to Viking Olav Tryggvason, which happens to be a sundial!
The nearby streets have some important buildings, namely the Church of Our Lady and Stiftsgården – a massive wooden building that acts as the local royal residence.'
